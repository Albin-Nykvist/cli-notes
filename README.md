Automatic note taking database for the command line. 
Simply write a note, and the program will add it to an appropriate place in the database.
Search the database using a fuzzy finder type search to find previous notes.

More feature ideas:
- Note walkthrough: read, edit and remove your latest notes to keep the database relevant and to review notes. 
- Note review: review notes one by one. Useful for lectures.
- Flashcard notes: for studying, get question, write quick answer, then compare your answer to saved answer. 
- Theme the app, like a cli-pet you write notes to that you can configure and have some fun commands for. 
  Pet, robot or some kind of mascot fits this, but should be optional, the default should be professional/office theme.
