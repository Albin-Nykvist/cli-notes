# 📓 Quick & Lightweight Command-Line Notetaking

**Note** is a minimalist **CLI notetaking tool**.  
It was built because I wanted a simple way to take notes during lectures, meetings, or any situation where it’s convenient to jot things down directly in the terminal.  

Unlike most note apps, **Note** separates **writing notes** from **organizing/saving notes**, so you can take notes instantly without worrying about organizing them.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 Review unsaved notes before committing them to collections  
- 📂 Organize notes into collections or delete them quickly  
- 📤 Export collections to text files for backup or sharing
