Quick and lightweight notetaking app for the command line. 

This project was made because I wanted a simple way to take notes via the command line. To make it as simple as possible for lectures and other spontanious quick notes, I separated the management and saving of notes from the writing of notes. 

The app works as follows:
1. The user writes a note that looks something like:
     ->noteapp This is my note
2. The user then reviews unsaved notes, and for every note, the user can choose where to save it or delete it:
     ->noteapp -r
3. The user can access saved notes in a similar way to the review.
